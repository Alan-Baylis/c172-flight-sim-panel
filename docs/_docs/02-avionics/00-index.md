# Avionics

The avionics stack is very much a work in progress and I will post details here as I proceed.

I intend to build a complete avionics stack for the X-Plane 11 Cessna 172 with an audio panel, Garmin GPS (GNS530 and GNS430), transponder, and auto-pilot.

## Garmin GMA 340

Work in progress.

## Garmin GNS 530

Work in progress.

## Garmin GNS 430

For parts and construction details refer to [Garmin GNS 430](./garmin-gns-430/).

## S-Tec Fifty-Five X
