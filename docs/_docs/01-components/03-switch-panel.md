# Switch Panel

The switch panel simulates a typical setup in a steam gauge Cessna 172. The panel houses a custom-built spring-return [key switch](#key-switch), simulated [fuses](#fuses), and toggle switches for the electrical buses, fuel pump, lighting, pitot heat, and avionics.

The panel is attached directly to the [frame](/docs/frame) with truss-head screws.

## Fuses

DPDT buttons with 3d-printed caps are mounted into the panel to simulate resettable fuses. 

The 3d printed caps are printed in white PLA, painted black, and then laser engraved to indicate the amperage of the fuse.

The button caps are 3d printed from white PLA, painted black, and then laser engraved.

The fuse amperage is laser-engraved after painting the button cap. The SVG has layers that can be toggled for the various fuse values.

A guide was created for aligning the button cap in the laser cutter.

## Fuse Button Mounts

The fuse switches are mounted to the back of the panel by gluing the switches into laser-cut acrylic strips.
