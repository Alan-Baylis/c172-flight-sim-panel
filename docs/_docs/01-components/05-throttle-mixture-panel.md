# Throttle and Mixture Panel

The throttle and mixture panel houses genuine Cessna 172 throttle and mixture controls, lighting rheostats, and the alt static air switch.

The panel is attached directly to the frame with truss-head screws.

## Bonus: Throttle and Mixture Knobs

I have created models of the throttle and mixture knobs using dimensions from genuine parts as I was unable to find actual dimensions for these components online when I was looking initially.

These might be of use in your project if you prefer to make your own controls.
