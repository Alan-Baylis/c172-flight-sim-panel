# Frame

I sketched out some general plans and key dimensions before building the frame but I built the support structure and cut-outs by measuring and modifying as I went. 

As a result, I don't have a single set of dimensional drawings of the frame yet but I plan on getting that documented and posted.

The image below is a work-in-progress photo from several months ago and several modifications have been made since.

More on this coming soon..
