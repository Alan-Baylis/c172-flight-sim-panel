# Garmin GNS 430

The Garmin GNS 430 is no longer in production but it continues to be ubiquitous in general aviation. This GPS is specifically designed for use with X-Plane 11.10 (or greater) and uses the [screen-only popup instrument window](https://developer.x-plane.com/2017/09/three-lesser-known-aircraft-features-for-11-10/) feature in X-Plane to render the GPS screen on an HDMI display that is integrated into the assembly.

## Faceplate

The faceplate is laser cut from white acrylic, painted black, and then laser engraved.

## Hardware Mount

The hardware mount provides a layer for mounting the push-buttons and the display. I used acrylic for mounting the push buttons to simplify construction and to avoid having to create a circuit board. The push buttons are glued into the hardware mount.

## Frame Mounts

The frame mounts are used to attach the assembly to the [frame](../../frame).

## Frame Mount Brackets

The frame mounts are attached to the hardware mount with these brackets and \#4 x 1/2" flat head screws.

### Display Mounting Clips

The display mounting clips secure the display to the hardware mount and to the faceplate. A shallow 1/8" hole is drilled into the rear of the faceplate. The clips are designed to work with \#6-32 x 1/2 pan head screws.

### Display Bezel

A 3d printed display bezel is sandwiched between the layers to compensate for the difference in thickness between the display and the hardware mount panel. The bezel also provides a clean finish and is similar to the bezel profile on a real GNS 430.
